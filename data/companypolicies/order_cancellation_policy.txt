Order Cancellation Policy

At EcoMart, we understand that circumstances may arise where you need to cancel your order. We strive to provide a flexible and hassle-free cancellation process for our customers. Please review our order cancellation policy below:

1. Eligibility for Order Cancellation:

Orders are eligible for cancellation under the following conditions:
The cancellation request is submitted before the order has been shipped.
The item(s) in the order are not marked as final sale or non-cancellable at the time of purchase.
Customized or personalized items may not be eligible for cancellation once production has begun.
2. Initiation of Order Cancellation:

To request an order cancellation, please contact our customer service team at support@ecomart.com or call +123456789 as soon as possible.
Provide your order number and a brief explanation of the reason for the cancellation.
Our customer service team will review your request and confirm the cancellation if the order is eligible.
